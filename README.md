# binary-tree

This is a solution for the [The Odin Project: Data Structures and Algorithms.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

Implementation of a binary search tree in Ruby for @TheOdinProject.

# Usage

`#build_tree` can be used to build a sorted binary tree from an array.

`#breadth_first_search` and `#depth_first_search` are both implemented.

Depth first search has also been implemented recursively as `dfs_rec`.
